                <h2>Web security Check</h2>
                <p>I help companies verify whether their web applications correctly separate user accounts from one another.</p>
                <p>Access control and authorization flaws occur surprisingly often — not only on small websites, but also within larger organizations and well-known platforms. In 2025, this was in fact the most common web security issue worldwide.</p>
                <p>These issues usually do not involve complex attacks, but rather logical scenarios in which a user can unintentionally view data or perform actions that were not intended for them.</p>
                <p>For this reason, I conduct a focused web security assessment to verify that user data, accounts, and user actions are properly protected within normal application workflows.</p>

                <h2>IT Support</h2>
                <p>I help individuals resolve phone, computer, and internet issues so their technology works reliably again.</p>
                <p>Technical problems occur more often than expected — not only with complex systems, but also during everyday tasks and routine use. In many cases, even small issues can disrupt work, communication, or daily life far more than they should.</p>
                <p>These problems usually do not require complex solutions, but rather clear diagnosis and practical fixes that address the real cause of the issue without unnecessary technical complexity.</p>
                <p>For this reason, I provide focused IT support to restore clarity, stability, and confidence in phones, computers, and internet connections within normal daily use.</p>
